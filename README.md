## Description

The Budget Tracker is an application that allows users to track and store deposits and expenses to keep track of their finances. A user can add new deposits or expenses while online or offline. A table is generated to show the user a log of their deposits and expenses, and a chart is generated to show the overall trend of the individual's account balance.
